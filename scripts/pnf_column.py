WHY THIS IS A PORT AND NOT A SUBMODULE
--------------------------------------
`pnf-charts` is a PRIVATE repo. A public repo's Actions token cannot clone it,
so the submodule route fails at checkout ("Repository not found") and the whole
column came back null.

The first instinct was to refuse to duplicate it -- two sources of truth for one
fact is what `parity_check.py` exists to prevent in `fno-rollover`. On reflection
that conflates two different kinds of sharing:

  * fno-rollover shares a CURATED TAXONOMY -- a dataset that drifts as names are
    added and removed. Duplicating that is genuinely unsafe.
  * this shares a FIXED ALGORITHM parameterised by (box_pct, reversal). Point &
    Figure box arithmetic does not drift; only those two constants can.

So the constants are pinned here, asserted against pnf-charts' own `PRESETS`
by `tests/test_pnf_parity.py`, and that test also proves this port produces
IDENTICAL output to `PnFChart.from_ohlc` on every locally cached symbol. The
test runs on the Mac, where the private repo is checked out; it cannot run on a
public runner, and it says so rather than passing vacuously.

Ported from pnf/boxes.py + pnf/chart.py @ pnf-charts, read 2026-09-29.
Only the LAST column is needed here, so fill timestamps and the level map --
which exist in the original to stop look-ahead in backtests -- are omitted.
